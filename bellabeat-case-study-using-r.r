Overview\n\nBellabeat is a cutting-edge tech firm that creates innovative medical devices. To educate and empower women, they provide a variety of smart devices that track physical activity, sleep, mental stress, and reproductive health. \n\nIn this case, we'll be looking at fitness data from intelligent devices to see if we can take advantage of any untapped expansion opportunities for Bellabeat. Below, we'll take a closer look at Bellabeat's flagship app. \n\nThe Bellabeat app tracks a user's activity, sleep, stress, menstrual cycle, and mindfulness practices and then displays this information to the user. Users will be able to gain insight into their current habits and make more informed choices about how to improve their health thanks to this information. When used in conjunction with their intelligent wellness products, the Bellabeat app can help you stay healthy and on track. \n\n\n## 2. Ask\n\n### 2.1 Business Task\n\nThis business task aims to inform the marketing strategy for Bellabeat products by analyzing consumer data from smart devices made by Bellabeat. The research will look for patterns in the participants' device usage and figure out how Bellabeat can incorporate those into its product line to boost sales and customer loyalty. The data collected will inform strategic marketing decisions and increase the efficiency of advertising initiatives.\n\nKey Stakeholders:\n\n* Urška Sršen, Bellabeat's cofounder and Chief Creative Officer\n* Sando Mur, Mathematician and Bellabeat's cofounder; key member of the Bellabeat executive team\n* Bellabeat marketing analytics team, responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that     helps guide Bellabeat's marketing strategy\n* Bellabeat customers, specifically those who use smart devices\n* Potential Bellabeat customers who may be interested in purchasing a smart device\n* Online retailers who sell Bellabeat products\n* Traditional advertising media partners such as radio, out-of-home billboards, print, and television.\n\n\n## 3. Prepare\n\n### 3.1 Data source\n\nOur investigation relies on information collected from FitBit fitness trackers. This dataset can be accessed through [Mobieus](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit) and is hosted in Kaggle.\n\n### 3.2 Data information\n\nTo the scope permitted by law, the author has relinquished all copyright protections worldwide for the work, including all rights that are derivative or adjacent to the job. It is possible to make copies, edit, distribute, and perform it, even for profit. Our investigation relies on information collected from FitBit fitness trackers. This dataset can be accessed through Mobius and is hosted in Kaggle.\n\nThirty Fitbit users gave their permission to submit personal tracker data, which included minute-by-minute output for exercise, heart rate, and sleep tracking. However, the varying results can be attributed to the wide variety of Fitbit trackers available and the fact that different people have different tracking habits and preferences.\n\nIn total, we have access to 18 separate CSV files. Fitbit's quantitative data is represented in multiple documents. Each row represents a single time point for each subject, so for each subject, there will be data in multiple rows. Since information is recorded in discrete chunks throughout the day, users have their ID and set of rows.\n\nThe data may have potential biases, as the sample consists of only 30 Fitbit users who opted to share their data. Therefore, the data may be different from the general population. To assess the credibility of the data, we can use the ROCCC framework (Relevant, Objective, Current, Complete, and Cited). In addition, the dataset needs to be updated, and the survey's timeline needs to provide timely results (2 months long). For this reason, we will take a pragmatic strategy in our case study.\n\n\n## 4. Process\n\n### 4.1 Installing and loading libraries\n\nThe following packages will be used for the analysis:\n\n* `tidyverse`\n* `dplyr`\n* `lubridate`\n* `ggpubr`\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"options(warn = -1, message =

On the other hand, individuals in the \"High\" step count category may be more physically active, which could result in shorter sleeping times due to increased energy levels and a more active lifestyle. However, this is just one possible explanation, and further investigation would be necessary to draw any conclusions about the relationship between step count category and total minutes asleep.\n\n\n### 5.4 Diving into the Body Mass Index\n\n\nNow let's take a look at the distribution of BMI in the data:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"ggplot(daily_activity_BMI, aes(x = BMI)) + \n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = \"#1f77b4\", color = \"white\") +\n  labs(title = \"Distribution of BMI\", x = \"BMI\", y = \"Count\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-02-21T21:19:32.404989Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-02-21T21:19:32.406677Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-02-21T21:19:32.669195Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"This produces a histogram of the BMI values in the data.

Act (Conclusion)\n\n\nBellabeat aims to give women the tools they need to find their identities through data. \n\nWe should use our tracking data for further analysis to respond to our business task and aid Bellabeat in its mission. However, since we needed more information on our users' demographics, the datasets we used had a small sample size and were potentially biased. Nevertheless, it's essential to keep an eye out for emerging trends so that we can tailor our marketing strategy to the needs of today's modern young and middle-aged women. \n\nNevertheless, after conducting this research, we have identified a few patterns that may be helpful for our digital marketing strategy and the development of the Bellabeat app:\n\n* BellaBeat should consider expanding its product line to include sleep monitoring features, as there is a potential link between physical activity and sleep quality that was identified in the data. This could help BellaBeat appeal to a wider range of consumers who are interested in improving their overall health and wellness.\n* Consider developing a personalized sleep tracking system: The analysis showed that sleep patterns varied significantly among users, which suggests that a one-size-fits-all approach may not be the most effective. Developing a system that allows users to track their sleep patterns and receive personalized recommendations based on their data could be a valuable feature for the company to consider.\n* BellaBeat should explore ways to make their products more engaging and interactive, as this could help increase user retention and encourage more consistent use of the products. This could include adding social features to the app, such as the ability to compete with friends or share achievements.\n* BellaBeat could partner with fitness and wellness influencers to help promote their products and reach a wider audience. Influencer marketing can be a very effective way to increase brand awareness and drive sales.\n","metadata":{}}]}
